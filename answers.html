<p>1. True! All cats are born with blue eyes because the newborn kitten's melanin level has not yet been established, 
    so their eyes reflect outside light which is seen as blue. Melanocyte cells respond to light and will start to make melanin in the 
    first few weeks after birth. Cats who retain blue eyes into adulthood do so because of low or no melanin production.</p>

<p>2. True! All cats have the tabby gene. If you look closely, even solid-colored cats have faint tabby markings.</p>
<p>3. B is correct. A group of cats is called a clowder.</p>
